    <div class="divclassmargin" > Smuggling of trees from forest has increased all over the world. Theft of such valuable trees has increased the risk of natural resource getting destroyed.
      The main objective of this project is to provide a solution to stop poaching or smuggling of trees by using IoT technology which uses sensors to prevent theft and send report to the officers and base station in case of any damage or theft of trees additionally it  provides fire alert and Stores data over cloud for further investigation if needed.

    <div class="divclassmargin">This system will help to find if there are any smuggling activities happening in our near forest. Trees like sandalwood, sag wan are most likely smuggled because they are more precious and also they are rarely found. There are also some trees that are used for medicinal purposes which are very useful .And also trees cover the need of the people to get oxygen, food etc. These trees are decreasing day by day because of which deforestation is taking place. And due to which problems like Global warming are increasing. To avoid such problems we have designed a system to stop the problem of deforestation. And this project will provide more accurate information of trees as it is embedded system . As it controls smuggling of the precious trees  it also balance economic of our nation .and also prevent smuggling of ayurvedic medicinal plant around the world. It will also give alert if  forest are destroyed for the construction of buildings, malls, amusement park, water park etc. In 2020 nearly 2.2 million hectares (5.4 million acres) of the Brazilian Amazonâ€™s standing rainforest burned last year, an area roughly the size of the country of Wales in the U.K. to avoid such conditions  our project has some sensors to detect such activities and it will immediately alert the forest officers . In some cases trees are destroyed by using chemicals at soil our project has some sensors to detect such chemicals . finally the main motive of this project is to prevent smuggling of precious trees and illegal deforestation
